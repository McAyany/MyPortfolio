## 🎨 Design Approach

1. **Reset & Base Styles** – Used a basic reset for consistency across browsers.
2. **Modular Layout** – Each section is spaced with `section` tags and scoped styling.
3. **Color Theme** – Clean, bright bluish theme using `#0a66c2` for accent and `#f0f4f8` background.
4. **Typography** – Sans-serif font family with comfortable line height for readability.
5. **Mobile First** – Layout is responsive using flexbox and grid.
